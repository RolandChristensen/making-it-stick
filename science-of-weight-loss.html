          <h3>Units of measurement</h3>
          <p>
            Learn Kg and kilojoules instead of pounds and calories. Kilojoules maybe tough considering most recipes and online calculators for food use calories.<br>
            <strong>Anthropometric Assessment and Measurement:</strong> These measurements assess a persons size dimensions and composition, proportions of muscle and fat tissue. Most frequently body weight, height, and waist circumference are used.<br>
            Accurate anthropometric measurements can tell you a lot about your health risks.<br>
            <strong>Weight:</strong> measure yourself the same time every day and on the same scale. Take a dump before weighing yourself, if you feel the need.<br>
            Height: Stand against a wall feet together, heels and head touching the wall, and mark the wall.<br>
            <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI):</strong> Uses height and weight to classify your fatness. BMI estimates proportions of population and is less effective at estimating body fatness of an individual. There are also limitations when using BMI to measure health/disease risk.<br>
            BMI does not take into consideration age, sex, or body composition. If you are a body builder, athlete, or a pregnant woman BMI will overestimate your risk. It also underestimates fat in the elderly where the proportion of fat is more likely.<br>
            Weight (kg) / Height<sup>2</sup> (m) = BMI<br>
            5% weight reduction = current weight - (current weight * 0.05)
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>Classification</td>

          <p>
            <strong>Waist Circumference:</strong> A predictor of risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.<br>
            Measuring your waist circumference is a simple check for excess abdominal body fat, also known as <strong>visceral fat</strong>.<br>
            Measure waist circumference by using tape measure halfway between your lowest rib and the top of the hip bone. Close to the belly button. The tape should be tight, but not squeezing the skin. Heavy people will find their belly button has gone south and they should measure at the narrowest point. Make sure to use the same spot each measurement.

            The smallest achievable goal is to lose 5% of your current weight. Losing 5% can:
            <ul>
              <li>Decrease risk of heart disease and cancer</li>
              <li>Improve sleep quality and quantity</li>
              <li>Decrease the risk of diabetes</li>
              <li>Improve mood</li>
              <li>Improve sexual function and health</li>
            </ul>
            To reach the highest weight for the normal range of BMI: <br>
            Weight (kg) = BMI (25) * Height<sup>2</sup> (m) (Fixed unless you are still growing :)<br>
            Going for small achievable goals is the recommended strategy. Evidence is mixed whether large goals are more effective or if they decrease motivation.<br>
            Recommendation is to have a long-term goal, but focus on the smaller short-term goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different Types of Weight Loss Goals:<br>
            <strong>Dream Weight</strong>: If you could weigh whatever you want.<br>
            <strong>Happy Weight</strong>: What would you be happy to weigh.<br>
            <strong>Acceptable Weight</strong>: Does not make you neccessarily happy, but acceptable because it is less than you currently weigh.<br>
            <strong>Dissappointed Weight</strong>: Less than current weight, but falling short of success
          </p>
          <p>
            Percent Reduction to Dream Weight = ((current weight - dream weight) / current weight) * 100 = ____%<br>
          </p>

          <h4>Obesity System Influence</h4>
          <p>
            The two main factors contributing to obesity are diet and exercise.<br>
            The range of social and psychological influences which affect diet and exercise are numerous and complex.<br>
            The full <strong>Obesity System Influence Diagram</strong> shows how interelated and complex all the factors can be.<br>
            A short list of factors are:
            <ul>
              <li>Stress: dependent on individual psychology and physiology.</li>
              <li>Percieved lack of time: dependent on individual activity and food consumption.</li>
              <li>Access to opportunities: Activity enrollment and individual activity.</li>
              <li>Level of Satiety: Individual physiology and food consumption.</li>
              <li>Dominance of motorized transport: Activity enrollment and individual activity.</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these overlap into other clusters. Individual activity is affected and effects many of these factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Goals and relative weights questionaire asks questions to help identify a persons weight loss motivations. This will help to identify appropriate strategies for success.<br>
            What are my goals for weight loss?<br>
            <ul>
              <li>I want to grow old gracefully and stay active until the day I die.</li>
              <li>I want to stave off diabetes and heart disease, which run in the family.</li>
              <li>I don't want to groan when getting out of a chair.</li>
              <li>I want to be able to jump rope and kick the dummy until the day I die.</li>
              <li>I want to extend this short life of mine as much as possible and be able to enjoy it.</li>
              <li>I never want to lose my ability to take care of myself no matter how old I become.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Weighing yourself at least once a week has been linked to greater weight loss. Use the scale to help you stay on track and warn you if a strategy is not working. The idea that you will get discouraged is a myth, weighing yourself is important data to keep you healthy.<br>
            Remember that you go through regular fluctuations and try not to get discouraged, but wait for the weight to swing the other way.<br>
            Your weight is a piece of data that helps you to assess your overall health. Chart your daily weight and see the trends.

          <h3>Guidelines for Long Healthy Life</h3>
          <p>
            Guidelines are used to help you avoid chronic diseases and other dietary-related health conditions.<br>
            There are specific diets that apply to those with special dietary needs and the usual guidelines may not apply to the elderly.<br>
            These quidelines vary from country to country. The Food and Agriculture Organization of hte United Nations has a site that shows many guidelines across different regions of the world.<br>
          </p>

          <h4>Veggies and Fruit</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Fresh or Frozen:</strong> frozen veggies are picked and frozen right away preservin their nutrition. Fresh has to travel to the store and then to your table, losing nutrition along the way.<br>
            <strong>Cooking Methods:</strong> steaming and microwaves are the best way to retain nutrients. Some vitamins are water soluble (Vitamin C) and are susceptible to boiling and heat. Boiling is bad for the vegetables and the environment. It takes longer to cook and uses more water and energy.<br>
            Raw vegetables may have more nutrients, but cooked vegetables are easier to digest and get the nutrients out of them.
          </p>

          <h4>Energy in Food (Calories and kilojoules)</h4>
          <p>
            1 Calorie = 4.18 kilojoules<br>
            1 kilojoule = 0.24 Calories<br>
            Calorie with a big "C" is what we measure food in. (1000 calories = 1 Calorie) It takes 1 Calorie to raise the temperature of 1L water 1&deg;C
            <strong>Macronutrients</strong><br>
            Alcohol is not needed by the body and contributes large amounts of energy to a person's daily intake.<br>
            Four types: <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Carbohydrates: 16 kilojoules per gram</li>
              <li>Proteins: 17 kilojoules per gram</li>
              <li>Fat: 37 kilojoules per gram</li>
              <li>Alcohol: 29 kilojoules per gram</li>
            </ol>
            Energy in a food depends on the ratio of macronutrients and the portion size.<br>
            This is known as the <strong>Energy Density</strong> of the food.<br>
            On average males 19-50 years should consume 9900-12700kJ (2368-3038C) per day to maintain weight<br>
            Women: 7600-9800kJ<br>
            This assumes a primarily sedentary job and 30-60 minutes of activity 4-5 times per week.<br>
            To lose weight you should consume less than those amounts<br>
            Of course, this all depends on your height, weight, and physical activity. You need to experiment to come up with the right numbers.<br>
            <strong>Engergy Density</strong><br>
            Energy density of a food is dependent on its macronutrient composition and is measured by dividing calories by the weight.<br>
            Low energy density foods are generally fruits and vegetables.<br>
            <strong>Track or strictly Plan Your Food Intake</strong><br>
            <ol>
              <li>Track everything you eat</li>
              <li>Be realistic about what you eat, if planning.</li>
              <li>Be as accurate as possible when logging what you eat and include brands, weight, how it was cooked (fried, baked, etc..), and any added sauces, sugar, etc..</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h4>Energy Expenditure</h4>
          <p>
            Amount of fuel burned depends on <strong>basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong> and <strong>resting metabolic rate (RMR)</strong><br>
            <strong>Basal metabolic rate</strong> is determined on waking, before any activity occurs.<br>
            <strong>Resting metabolic rate</strong> is still measured after waking, but after a small amount of activity (after getting out of bed, going to the bathroom, weighing yourself).<br>
            BMR/RMR is usually 3 to 6kJ per minute (e.g. 24 hr * 60min * 3kJ = 4320kJ/day).<br>
            <br>
            Factors influencing BMR include:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Body Size</strong>: a larger body the higher BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Sex</strong>: males usually have a higher BMR (due to the higher muscle mass men usually have)</li>
              <li><strong>Body fat</strong>: higher proportions of fat to muscle, leads to lower BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Fasting</strong>: fasting decreases BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Caffiene</strong>: can increase BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Nicotine</strong>: can increase BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Medications</strong>: some can increase or decrease BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Infection</strong>: severe infections or injury can increase BMR</li>
              <li><strong>Thyroid hormones</strong>: hyperthyroid increases BMR, hypothyroid decreases BMR</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Total Energy Expenditure (TEE)</strong><br>
            <br>
            The total energy you use across the whole day is TEE.<br>
            Determined from either the BMR or RMR by mulitplying by an activity factor as described below.<br>
            TEE equals the total kJs you body needs per day to maintain your current weight.<br>
            There are a few equations used to estimate a person's TEE. They are all similar and use the following parameters:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Age</li>
              <li>Sex</li>
              <li>Height</li>
              <li>Weight</li>
              <li>Physical Activity Level</li>
            </ul>
            <table>
              <caption><strong>Physical Activity Level (PAL)</strong></caption>

          <h4>Energy Restricted Diets</h4>
          <p>
            Restrictions are meant to lose weight or maintain weight. They can be easier to stick with, but result in slower weight loss or more difficult with quicker weight loss.<br>
            <strong>Energy Deficit</strong>: You can either increase energy burned or decrease calories consumed.<br>
            <strong>Reduced Energy Diets (REDs)</strong>: Identify ways to reduce a person's current eating habits by 2000-4000kJs (478-956C) per day.<br>
            They usually involve swapping energy dense food for low energy density foods and managing portion size.<br>
            REDs have the highest adherance in the long term, meaning sustained weight loss with slower weight loss.<br>
            <strong>Low Energy Diets (LEDs)</strong>: Use daily energy intake targets between 4200-7000kJ (1004-1673C). Usually involves following a prescribed diet plan and pre-portioned meals.<br>
            LEDs usually result in low to moderate adherance but can take the hassle out of planning and cooking meals.<br>
            <strong>Very Low Energy Diets (VLEDs)</strong>: has a very low total daily energy intake target, consuming 2500-4000kJs (596-956C) per day. Usually involves, Formulated Meal Replacements (FMR) replacing meals with nutrient enhanced calorie reduced shakes or bars for full meals and/or use low carbohydrate diets. It is recommended to consume 2 cups vegetables to help boost fibre and vitamin intake and 20g (1Tablespoon) oil to keep gallbladder contracting.<br>
            VLEDs cause rapid weight loss, but are recommended only under doctor supervision. They are hard to adhere to. There are a lot of other side effects that may come along with the VLEDs. A list includes light-headedness, fatigue, headaches, bad breath, constipation, increased risk of gall bladder disease, liver inflammation, and gout.<br>
            <strong>Summary:</strong> REDs are the easist diets to adhere to, but the weight loss is slower. VLEDs are the hardest to adhere to and can come with side effects, but have the greatest amount of weight loss.<br>
            The aim is to swap high energy density foods with lower energy density foods. The idea being that you will feel full, but consume fewer calories. Swap chocolate, cake, fizzy drinks, sweets for fruit, vegetables, dip, or yoghurt.<br>
            Another way to do this is to divide your plate into one half vegetables, one quarter protein (lean is better), and one quarter carbohydrate.<br>
            Lowering the energy density includes using low-fat alternatives.<br>
            The idea here is that you can eat a large meal, feel full, and still reduce calories.
            <strong>Sugar Substitutes</strong>: Sugar substitues reduce calories and add a sweet taste. (I disagree with the sweet taste part.) Some think that using artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, due to it stimulating appetite are probably wrong. It is more likely that people think because they have done good, they can eat more or another food. Studies in humans have not shown any adverse effects using artificial sweeteners and if you do not overcompensate and eat more of other items you are saving calories.
            <strong>Sugar synonyms</strong>: The list of sugar synonyms is non-exhaustive.
            <ul>
              <li>Dextrose</li>
              <li>Fructose</li>
              <li>Glucose</li>
              <li>* Syrup (Golden Syrup, Maple Syrup, etc..)</li>
              <li>Honey</li>
              <li>Sucrose</li>
              <li>Malt</li>
              <li>Maltose</li>
              <li>Lactose</li>
              <li>* sugar (Brown sugar, palm sugar, etc..)</li>
              <li>Agave</li>
              <li>Molasses</li>
              <li>Rice Malt Syrup</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Carbohydrates</strong>: They are not the cause of weight gain, that is a myth. It is easy to eat a lot of them without feeling full. You can eat a lot of pasta or sweets without feeling full. If you don't burn those calories they turn into fat.<br>
            <strong>Complex Carbs</strong>: Rice, pasta, breads, vegetables, legumes with the wholemeal varieties preferred.<br>
            <strong>Simple Carbs</strong>: Energy dense, nutrient poor foods such as cookies, pastries, fizzy drinks. (Mostly sugar)<br>
            The take away is to eat complex carbs (whole variety preferrentially) over simple ones and supplement carbs with a bunch of veggies to make yourself feel full.
          </p>
          <h4>Intermittent Fasting Diets</h4>
          <p>
            Intermittent fasting is an example of a "combination" energy restriction. It is recommended that people follow a VLED anywhere from one to three days a week, except the energy comes from food rather than FMRs. The other days, follow a RED or LED.<br>
            There is no long term studies to back this method, but short terms studies are promising.<br>
            Level of difficulty varies on fasting days to normal restriction days.<br>
            On fasting days, the target is a quarter of a normal days intake.<br>
            5:2 diets recommend 2 days fast after five days normal restriction.<br>
            <strong>Negative Effects</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>The fasting may lead to cravings and over-eating or stress.</li>
              <li>There is insufficient evidence on the long term effects on your metabolism.</li>
              <li>May lead to malnutrition, if a person's diet is nutritionally inadequate to begin with.</li>
              <li>Not suitable for pregnant women.</li>
              <li>May not be suitable for people with diabetes. Medical supervision is required.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
          <p>
            Macronutrients are nutrients required in large quantities by the body.<br>
            The three main macronutrients are carbs, proteins, and fat.<br>
            Carbohydrates are the body's preferred energy source.<br>
            Proteins have important roles in growth and repair of tissues such as skin and hair, muscles and body organs. They also affect hormones and help to fight infections.<br>
            Proteins are the least needed by the body, but should not be overlooked.<br>
            Fats help you body absorb vitamins and is needed by membranes of all body cells and is used to make hormones and maintain healthy skin.<br>
            The consensus is that you should reduce the amount of saturated fat to avoid heart disease and stroke. Butter, cream, ice-cream, full-fat milk and cheese, salami, bacon, chicken skin, fatty cuts of beef, coconut milk, etc..<br>
            Try to replace saturated fats with monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. <br>
            Monounsaturated fats include: Avocado, olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, nuts, margarines, etc..<br>
            Polyunsaturated fats include: Oily fish such as salmon, tuna, trout, some nuts (walnuts), and nut oils (sunflower, sesame, flax)<br>
            <br>
            Most foods have a combination of macronutrients. Exceptions do occur, sugar is a pure carbohydrate, egg white is a pure protein, and oil is a pure fat.
          </p>

          <h3>Micronutrients</h3>
          <p>
            Required in much smaller amounts than macronutrients, but are important for growth and development. (Vitamins and minerals)
          </p>

          <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
          <p>
            The bodies preferred energy source. Why?<br>
            <strong>Complex</strong>: Take longer to digest, which makes you feel fuller for longer.<br>
            <strong>Simple</strong>: Digest rapidly and therefore are not satisfying for the long term.<br>
            For weight loss prefer complex over simple carbs.<br>
            Legumes (e.g. Lentils, soy beans, baked beans, kidney beans, chickpeas) are all considered Carbohydrates.<br>
            Vegetables such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and peas are also considered carbohydrates.
          </p>

          <h3>Proteins</h3>
          <p>
            Despite its importance in the growth and repair of tissues, hormone functions, immune responses, and fighting infections, the amount you need is small compared to other macronutrients.<br>
            <strong>Non-amino acids</strong>: can be manufactured by the body.<br>
            <strong>Essential amino acids</strong>: must be consumed, so must be included in our diet.<br>
            <strong>Complete proteins</strong>: Food that provides all of the essential amino acids.<br>
            Animal sources of protein (Meat, poultry, seafood, milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs) contain complete proteins.<br>
            Plant sources of protein are not complete, but foods that provide good protein are nuts, seeds, legumes, and soy products.
          </p>

          <h3>Fats</h3>
          <p>
            Fat is essential for the nervous system and helps transport fat soluble vitamins and minerals.<br>
            Reduce the amount of saturated fats and replace with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.<br>
            Use olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, flaxseed oil before butter, ghee, and coconut oil.<br>
            Prefer oily fish such as salmon, tuna, trout and herring over beef, pork, lamb, chicken with skin, and processed meats (salami, bacon, ham, and lunch meat).<br>
            Avocado, nuts, olives are all good fatty foods.<br>
            Full fat dairy, coconut milk/cream, and processed/fast food are all bad fats.
          </p>

          <h3>Alcohol</h3>
          <p>
            Considered a macronutrient due to the calories added to your diet, but has no other value to your physical well being.<br>
            Alcohol may hamper loss of fat mass, due to the fact that the body does not store alcohol and simply burns it leaving fat stores alone.
          </p>

          <h3>Macronutrient Manipulation for Weight Management</h3>
          <p>
            You should not cut out any of the three main macronutrients completely, as they are needed by the body. Diets that restrict one or more of them are not recommended.<br>
            A healthy range is:
            <ul>
              <li>Carbohydrates: 45-65%</li>
              <li>Fat: 20-35%</li>
              <li>Protein: 14-25%</li>
            </ul>
            Adjust percentages to your preferences and health guidelines for any conditions.<br>
            The <strong>Total Energy Intake</strong> is the important factor for losing weight.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Discretionary Foods</strong>: Foods that are extremely high in energy density, like high fat meats (bacon) and high sugar carbohydrates (candy bars) are easy wins to cut as much as possible from your diet. Use with discretion, but total calories is what you are trying to reduce. The problem with discretionary foods is that you get a lot of calories, but still feel hungry.
            <br>
            Look for alternatives to your usual foods that are reduced energy density and reduced saturated fat.
          </p>

          <h3>Portion Control for Weight Management</h3>
          <p>
            Evidence suggests that making portion sizes smaller is good for reducing energy intake. People eat the same number of food items regardless of portion size. If you cut food into smaller pieces they eat the same number of pieces.<br>
            Evidence also suggests that people eat more food if it is on a bigger plate. Downsize all of your serving dishes.<br>
            <br>
            You may want to start to train yourself to recognize what a serving size of your favorite foods should look like.<br>
            For example: measure out what a portion of pasta should look like and start to recognize how much you should be eating.<br>
            Also, don't eat right out of the bag. (e.g. don't each nuts right out of the can or bag, measure them first.)<br>
            <strong>Portion size vs. serving size</strong>: The serving size is what you read about on the label of a product. The portion size is what you actually serve up for yourself.
          </p>

          <h3>Mindful Eating</h3>
          <p>
            Being present when eating and bringing a greater awareness of the experience. Pay attention to your physical hunger cues and satiation cues.<br>
            It was shown in one long term study that mindful eaters were able to keep the weight off longer.<br>
            Being mindful when eating should at least trigger warnings when you are overeatting (bingeing) and eating impulsively or emotional eating.<br>
            <br>
            Pay attention to every little detail when eating, otherwise you won't enjoy the food as much as possible.<br>
            Pay attention while eating (avoid distractions) to see how you feel and pay attention to what you feel when you get the urge to eat. What takes you into the kitchen? As you reach for that handful of nuts, sweet, or yogurt, what is going through your mind?<br>
            <br>
            Keep a <em>Food and Mood</em> diary to identify eating habits and the moods associated with your food habits. Look for emotional eating, eating out of boredom, going too long between meals, grazing throughout the day, or eating when not hungry and out of habit.<br>
            Knowledge allows you to develop strategies to counter these habits.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Mindful Eating and Environment Checklist</strong><br>
            Choose a calm and relaxed environment to eat.<br>
            Do not allow any distractions from screens or anything else.<br>
            Allow 20-30 minutes eating time for a meal, 10-15 for a snack (if you allow for snacks).<br>
            Before eating, check the rating below to see how hungry you are.<br>
            Before eating, do an emotional inventory to see if you are eating for necessity or emotionally.<br>
            Before eating, take time to admire the look and smell of the dish.<br>
            While eating, take time to enjoy how the food tastes and feels<br>
            While eating, put your utensil down between each bite.<br>
            While eating, count the number of chews (if the food is chewable, 10-20 chews) to make sure you are savoring the food and allowing time to get the full signal.<br>
            While eating, check in to see how full you are when half finished with dish and three quarters finished using the rating system below.<br>
            After eating, check in again with how full you feel using the rating system below. Try to keep it in the 5 to 7 range.<br>
            After eating, ask yourself if you should change anything next time to make yourself happier and healthier.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Hunger and Fullness Cues Rating</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Ravenous, shaky, lightheaded, hunger pains</li>
              <li>Slight pain in stomach, hard to concentrate, tired</li>
              <li>Starting to show signs of hunger, occasional stomach noises</li>
              <li>Could eat</li>
              <li>Neutral</li>
              <li>Satisfied</li>
              <li>Feel food in stomach</li>
              <li>Some bloating, stomach sticks out</li>
              <li>Bloated, clothes feel tight, tired, lack of energy</li>
              <li>Full, stomach uncomfortable, tired, feel unwell</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Methods of Dietary Intake Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Dietary intake is a good way to begin a weight loss program. It is a way to identify priorities in what habits you want to focus on first.<br>
            <strong>The 24 hour recall method</strong> asks you to recall everything you ate over the last 24 hours.<br>
            <strong>Diet History</strong> is similar to the 24 hour recall, but focuses on a longer time frame to try to get a picture of how a person regularly eats.<br>
            <strong>A food record</strong> that can be weighed or estimated. It is a record kept over 4-7 days, including at least one weekend day, and should be as complete as possible, including food, cooking method, amount, etc.. Take pictures of each meal if you don't have time to write everything down.<br>
            <strong>Food Frequency Questionaire</strong> are self reported and tries to identify trends of certain types of food, quantity, frequency of meals and snacks, etc.<br>
            <br>
            The simple act of recording everything you eat and when begins to challenge your eating habits.<br>
            Try not to get focused too much on one type of food or habit, but remember to record everything to get an overall picture of your dietary habits.<br>
          </p>

          <h3>Physical Activity and Weight Management</h3>
          <p>
            Your daily intake of energy should equal the amount burned to stay the same weight. The amount burned increases with physical exercise.<br>
            The three factors to consider when figuring out how much energy exercise uses are: duration, frequency, and intensity.<br>
            This also depends on sex, which is unlikely to change, and your weight, which hopefully does not change frequently. Your goal is to reach a goal weight and maintain it for a very long time.<br>
            <strong>Health professional recommend 150-300 minutes of moderate activity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous activity per week.</strong> Five days of exercise for 30-60 minutes or five days of vigorous exercise for 15-30 minutes.<br>
            You can do exercise in as small a block of time as 10 minutes, but with more blocks of exercise per week.<br>
            Moderate and vigorous are not well defined terms. Generally, moderate activity includes fast walking, cycling, and easy swimming. Vigorous activity, generally, is where your heart beats rapidly and you sweat more. Vigorous activities include running, fast swimming, or heavy weight training.<br>
            For our purposes make sure you hit at least 150 minutes of activity that raises your heart rate and makes you sweat. The more minutes that have you sweating profusely and has your heart beating and lungs working, so that you feel like quiting the better. That feeling of wanting to quit means you are pushing yourself. Make sure you feel that at least once a week.<br>
            <strong>Health professionals recommend at least 2 days of strength training per week.</strong><br>
            There are online calculators that will attempt to tell you how much energy you have burned during exercise. This may be useful to you.<br>
            Sex, Age, height, and weight all change the amount of energy burned.<br>
            Men generally burn more calories than women during exercise. It has to do with muscle to fat ratio, men generally have more muscle and less fat than women.<br>
            With age you lose muscle mass, so as you age less calories are burned during exercise.<br>
            The more additional weight you carry the more calories you burn during exercise. By additional weight, means that for your height what is your "healthy" weight.<br>
            <br>
            You cannot outrun a bad diet! If all you eat is french fries you would need to run marathons every day to maintain a healthy weight. Also, saturated fats and sugars have other deliterious effects that are independent of exercise, so even if you ran marathons the bad effects of these would still be felt.<br>
            <br>
            Live your physical life mindfully. Think of things you can do in your regular day to day that will increase the intensity and duration of your everyday activities.<br>
            <br>
            To demonstrate how detrimental some foods are, get the calorie count and figure out how long it would take to burn those calories doing various exercises.<br>
            Example: how long would it take on the treadmill to burn the calories in a chocolate mousse.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid elevators when there are stairs</li>
            <li>Walk or ride instead of using the car</li>
            <li>Park in the back to walk further</li>
            <li>Take activity breaks during your day</li>
            <li>Use a treadmill desk</li>
            <li>Do more housework or gardening</li>
            <li>Use a standing desk</li>
            <li>Stand during things you usually would sit for (talking on the phone, reading, watching TV, etc..)</li>
            <li>Walk around the house while brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>Walk around while doing things you would usually stand for</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Barriers to Exercise: How to Overcome Them</h3>

            <li>lack of time: break it up into 10 minute increments throughout the day</li>
            <li>lack of space: search for exercises that require little space (jog in place)</li>
            <li>cost: there are a lot of body weight exercises that require no equipment and there are free routines on the internet, develop your own</li>
            <li>access to facilities or walking/bike tracks: search for free exercise routines on the internet, develop your own</li>

            <li>health conditions: you can figure it out, work with your medical professional</li>
            <li>lack of motivation: there is no shortage of advise on the internet, just keep thinking about exercise and find fun / interesting ways to get yourself moving more often, whatever you do most often, try to incorporate motion into it</li>

          <h3>Fad Diets</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Promise fast weight loss</li>
            <li>Not based on science</li>
            <li>Tells you it is a "one size fits all" diet</li>
            <li>Is only a short term fix</li>

            <li>Is likely to tell you to eliminate food groups/specific nutrients</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Common Issues with Extreme Diets</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Restrictive</li>
            <li>Cravings</li>
            <li>Hard to Eat Out</li>

            <li>Dangerous</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Diets that encourage carbohydrate elimination or severe reduction, show a rapid weight loss initially due to water loss accompanying the carbohydrate stores. As time continues the weight loss slows and stops. The intitial rapid weight loss lures the suckers in.
          </p>
          <h3>Rapid Weight Loss</h3>
          <p>
            Rapid Weight Loss: Loss greater than 1 kg (2.2 lb) per week.<br>
            <strong>Side Effects Short Term</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Dehydration</li>
              <li>Irritability</li>
              <li>Fatigue</li>

              <li>Electrolyte Imbalance</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Side Effects Long Term</strong>

              <li>Disordered Eating</li>
            </ul>
            These make it difficult to maintain diets and can lead to more serious health issues.<br>
            It is recommended to lose weight slower for health and maintainability.
          </p>
          <h3>Bad Diets</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Blood Type Diets are NOT RECOMMENDED</strong><br>
            Based on the bullshit that depending on your blood type you should restrict lectins (proteins found in food).<br>
            There is no science to back up this claim.<br>
            Adherents may see benefits, but this is due to the healthy eating principles that are backed by science the diet also recommends.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Zero Sugar Diets are NOT RECOMMMENDED</strong><br>
            This is not supported by scientific evidence.<br>
            Sugar is in a lot of good foods such as fruit and yogurt which contain essential micronutrients<br>
            Sugar should be reduced, but not eliminated completely.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Lemon Detox Diet is NOT RECOMMENDED</strong><br>
            Detox/clense diets claim that eating in a certain way will remove toxins from your body, which is always bullshit. Your body can remove any toxins all by itself without the aid of a detox or clense. It is a simple con with a scare tactic sales pitch.<br>
            There is no science to back this diet.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Carnivore Diet</strong><br>
            This is not supported by science.<br>
            The claims are that you will improve your blood sugar levels and mood and, of course, weight loss. All of those things can be improved with a well balanced diet, without the side effects of a diet lacking in fibre, vitamins, and minerals found in vegetables and grains and a diet high in saturated fats.<br>
            <strong>Carnivore Diet is NOT RECOMMENDED</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Ketogenic Diet</strong><br>
            "Keto" diets are high in fat and low in carbohydrates. It was developed to manage epilepsy. If you don't have epilepsy, don't do it.<br>
            The claim is that once you eliminate carbohydrates from your diet you will begin to use "ketones" for fuel. Once you start burning fat produced ketones, you will reduce hunger and trigger the use of fat as your fuel source.<br>
            While not entirely bullshit, the diet is hard to adhere to, low in fibre, and high in saturated fat. If all else fails, give it a try, but only with the help of a professional.<br>
            <strong>Keto is NOT RECOMMENDED</strong>
            <br>
          </p>

          <h3>The Success Trap</h3>
          <p>
            People think that drinking diet soda makes you gain weight. The fake sugar does not do anything to you to make you gain weight, the problem is that a person convinces themsleves that they have <em>earned</em> eating additional food or a treat if they drink a diet soda.<br>
            This happens with lots of successes. "I lost my goal of five pounds, so I will have a celebratory feast," is a common thing I have said. <em>Cheat days</em> are common and simply undermine your achievments. You can include treats as part of your diet, but understand that you will not lose as much weight and progress will be slower, but this may be a grown up way of thinking of things and easier to stick to than a highly restrictive diet. Your scale and waistline will tell you if you are overdoing it.

          <h3>Weight Stigma</h3>
          <p>
            Those who do not fit into the social norms of body weight and shape. Women are held to standards unrealistic to most and targeted by the childish fucks in our society.<br>
            The immature fucks are media, including the news, social media, movies and serialized video. The obese are underrepresented and when they are they are not treated respectfully.<br>
            <br>
            Health professionals often have biases toward the thin and are anti-fat. (Of course, there are a lot of health complications when overweight, but the biases lead people to treat obesity as if it is a deficit of character, low intelligence, or vice.)<br>
            Institutional weight stigma discriminates against people with obesity through policies or laws.<br>
            <br>
            Weight stigma can exacerbate issues, leading to social isolation, avoidance of healthcare, which can lead to binge eating and further weight gain. The stress of weight stigma leads to a psychological stress response, leading to cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.<br>
            Obviously, weight stigma can lead to mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts, particularly for young people.<br>
            <br>
            Health promotion campaigns that display signs of weight stigma (toxic fat, blaming individuals and emphasising personal responsibility) can actually reduce people's motivation to engage in healthy behaviours.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Negative Terms that Hurt People</strong>: Fat, obese people.<br>
            <strong>Nuetral Terms</strong>: Weight, Unhealthy Weight, People with Obesity.<br>
            <strong>People First Terms</strong>: People with Obesity.
          </p>

          <h3>Healthy Weight Loss Plans</h3>
          <p>
            Foster long term sustainable behaviour changes.<br>
            Do not exclude particular food groups or nutrients.<br>
            Foster healthy eating behaviours, greater physical activity, and find support to make these changes.<br>
            Set realistic weight loss goals of 5-10% weight or 0.5-1kg (1-2lb.) per week.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Common features of successful weight loss programs/plans</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Encourage eating breakfast every day</li>
              <li>Cooking meals at home</li>
              <li>Decreasing portion size</li>
              <li>Promote food from all 5 health food groups</li>
              <li>Treats within moderation</li>
              <li>Very low energy diets that are nutrient sufficient only under medical supervision</li>
              <li>Balanced in macro and micronutrients</li>
              <li>Sustainability is key</li>
              <li>Easy to follow</li>
              <li>Promote whole foods, while not completely banning less healthy foods</li>
              <li>Based on an extensive base of evidence</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)</h3>
          <p>
            Designed to lower or prevent high blood pressure. Changes due to this diet sometimes result in weight loss, even though it is not the main goal. Those who eat a diet high in energy dense nutrient poor food will lose weight when shifting to this diet.<br>
            <br>
            Eat more fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, lean proteins, and dairy. This also focuses on decreasing salt consumption to less than 2,300mg per day (1,500mg goal).<br>
            Energy dense/nutrient poor (discretionary) foods and red meats are limited, but not banned.<br>
            6-8 servings of grains<br>
            4-5 servings of vegetables<br>
            4-5 servings of fruit<br>
            2-3 servings of dairy<br>
            6 servings or less lean meats<br>
            4-5 servings of nuts/legumes/seeds per week<br>
            2-3 servings of fats/oils<br>
            Less than 5 servings sweets per week
          </p>

          <h3>Mediterranean Diet</h3>
          <p>
            More of a eating pattern than a diet. Eating this way leads to energy restriction and the amount leads to the amount of weight loss.<br>
            <strong>Eat these things:</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Fruits</li>
              <li>Vegetables</li>
              <li>Wholegrains</li>
              <li>Legumes</li>
              <li>Nuts</li>
              <li>Olive Oil</li>
              <li>Fish/Seafood</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Eat these things a few times a week:</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Poultry</li>
              <li>Eggs</li>
              <li>Cheese</li>
              <li>Yogurt</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Eat these things occasionally:</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Sweets</li>
              <li>Red Meat</li>
            </ul>
            This is a good diet to help with diabetes and heart disease.<br>
            Overall health will improve even if you don't lose weight.
          </p>

          <h3>Weight Watchers</h3>
          <p>
            Designed specifically for weight loss.<br>
            Uses a point system to calculate healthy food choices, which makes it easier to make decisions, but is time consuming.<br>
            It helps you to learn portion control and gives you a support group.<br>
            It is expensive.
          </p>

          <h3>Mayo Clinic Diet</h3>
          <p>
            Specifically designed for weight loss.<br>
            Consists of two phases the "Lose It" and the "Live It".<br>
            <strong>Lose It</strong> involves adding new habits<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Eat a healthy breakfast</li>
              <li>Eat lots of fruits and vegetables</li>
              <li>Choose wholegrains</li>
              <li>Use healthy fats</li>
              <li>Exercise 30 minutes per day</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Breaking old habits</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Stop eating while watching TV</li>
              <li>Stop eating processed sugar</li>
              <li>Stop snacking (except fruits and vegetables)</li>
              <li>Stop consuming excess meat or full-fat dairy</li>
              <li>Stop eating out (in most cases)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Adopt other additional healthy habits:</strong><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep a food diary</li>
              <li>Keep a activites diary</li>
              <li>Keep a goal diary</li>
              <li>Exercise more than 60 minutes per day</li>
              <li>Minimise processed foods</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>The "Live It" phase</strong><br>
            Continue with the "Lose It" phase to build lifelong habits and allow occasional treats.<br>
            <br>
            The Mayo Clinic Diet book is a one time cost.
          </p>

          <h3>Flexitarian Diet</h3>
          <p>
            Flexible vegetarians eat vegetarian a certain number of meals periodically. A good start is to eat vegetarian three or more days per week. Generally, vegetarians have a lower weight and BMI.<br>
            Meat alternatives are used, such as tofu, legumes, nuts, seeds, and eggs.<br>
            This is based on science and developed by a registered dietitian.<br>
            <br>
            The Flexitarian diet book may be a good investment.
          </p>

          <h3>Maintenance Strategies</h3>
          <p>
            Self Monitoring brings awareness. This allows us to react to any rebounds quickly. Track your weight, measurements, exercise, and food/calorie intake.<br>
            <br>
            Be mindful of portion size. You can determine your own portion sizes for regularly eaten foods or buy preportioned foods. Be consistent. Be especially mindful of the portion size of energy dense foods.<br>
            <br>
            Eating breakfast regularly is linked to weight maintenance. Breakfast containing protein or wholegrains are best. The theory is that you will feel full and reduce the likelihood of binging.<br>
            <br>
            Eat low-fat not no-fat combined with nutrient rich lower energy density foods. Eat more veg and less fat.<br>
            <br>
            Avoid take-out.<br>
            <br>
            Have at least 2 servings of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables per day.<br>
            <br>
            Be consistent. Successful losers are able to say <strong>no</strong>. Not just on weekdays, but weekends and holidays as well.<br>
            <br>
            Working out 60 minutes five days a week is linked to success. Those who sit more than move are more likely to regain weight.<br>
            <br>
            Getting support from those around you, especially if they participate with you is a good strategy.<br>
            <br>
            Finding an accredited practicing dietician is good.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>National Weight Control Registry says the most successful weight maintainers</strong>:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Almost 8 out of 10 people (78%) eat breakfast every day</li>
              <li>Just over 7 out of 10 people (75%) weigh themselves at least once per week</li>
              <li>6 out of 10 people (62%) watch less than 10 hours of TV per week</li>
              <li>9 out of 10 people (90%) exercise on average about 1 hour per day</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Search for the strategy or strategies that work best for you at this time. Add strategies as you are able and if you slip have a back up plan to retry or abandon a strategy in favor of one that you are more likely to stick with.<br>
            Find where you struggle and look for strategies to help.<br>
            <br>
            Example: You find it hard to get motivated to work out. You spend a lot of time thinking about it before you are able to get up the motivation to do it. Other times, you don't get the motivation and instead take a nap.<br>
            Try getting in touch with some supportive friends to work out with.<br>
            <br>
            Example: You have been successful, but are now starting to gain weight again.<br>
            Try monitoring your food intake carefully to see if you notice a change.<br>
            <br>
            Keep a log book to record all of these strategies, so you know what works and what doesn't and to remember what you have tried.
          </p>

          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>
            I prepared my food and only ate half and put the other half in the fridge. I drank water and if I really wanted more I knew I could get it out of the fridge. I found I didn't want the other half. I find by preparing food in advance and putting it in my food diary. I ate what I planned.<br>
            <br>
            I varied my exercise, so I didn't get bored easily.<br>
            <br>
            I cook in bulk and freeze stuff. It was convenient and easy if I had a tough day and didn't want to cook and there are no leftovers for overeating later.<br>
            <br>
            I don't buy things that will tempt me later. I don't bring them into the house.<br>
            <br>
            I found a running friend who runs with me and we train for these events throughout the year.
          </p>

          <h3>Weight Loss Correlations</h3>
          <p>
            NWCR tracks the following. Adults who have maintained a weight loss of at least 13kg for one year have these key features:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>80% are women</li>
              <li>The average woman is 45 years old and weighs 66kg</li>
              <li>The average man is 49 years old and weights 86kg</li>
              <li>Registry members have lost an average of 30kg and kept it off for over 5 years</li>
              <li>Duration of successful weight loss maintenance has ranged from 1 year to 66 years</li>
            </ul>
            Within this group there is a lot of variation:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Weight losses hae ranged from 14 to 136kg</li>
              <li>Some have lost the weight rapidly, while others have lost weight very slowly</li>
              <li>45% lost the weight on their own while the other 55% lost weight with the help of a program</li>
              <li>98% reported they modified their food intake in some way</li>
              <li>94% increased their physical activity, with walking being the most reported form of activity</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Diets Don't Work or Do They</h3>
          <p>
            Diets can work, but you need to think of them as dietary patterns that you plan on sticking with for life. Also, weight loss programs are not one size fits all. Find the pattern that works for you over the long term.
