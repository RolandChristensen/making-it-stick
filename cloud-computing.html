          <h3>The Cloud</h3>
          <p>
            A metaphore for the internet often represented by an image of a cloud.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>: using remote services to accomplish what used to be done on a single computer. Applications, networks, servers, services, storage, etc, in cyberspace where anybody can access them from any computer (if authorized).<br>
            They can be provisioned quickly and released when done using, with little to no interaction.<br>
            <br>
            The three main categories of automated provisioning and releasing of resources:
            <ul>
              <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
              <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
              <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
            </ul>
            Recently, many new models have cropped up:
            <ul>
              <li>Analytics as a Service (AnaaS)</li>
              <li>API as a Seervice (AaaS)</li>
              <li>Big Data as a Service (BDaaS)</li>
              <li>Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)</li>
              <li>Code as a Service (CaaS)</li>
              <li>Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS)</li>
              <li>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</li>
              <li>Database as a Service (DBaaS)</li>
              <li>Function as a Service (FaaS)</li>
              <li>Monitoring as a Service (MaaS)</li>
              <li>Anything as a Service (XaaS)</li>
            </ul>
            Cloud service providers supply a web interface and other consoles and dashboards to improve the user experience.<br>
            Pay-as-you-go allows users to pay for only what they use and avoids the expensive up front cost of setting them up for yourself.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Speed and Agility: provisioned quickly</li>
            <li>Cost: Upfront costs are eliminated, so you can focus on the return on investment. Look for a cost estimator on your cloud provider.</li>
            <li>Easy Access: access anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
            <li>Maintenance: Infrastructure maintenance is not your problem, unless they fail to do their job well.</li>
            <li>Multitenancy: You share the cost with other tenants using the resources.</li>
            <li>Reliability: redundancy across multiple locations ensures you are up and never lose data.</li>
            <li>Scalability and Elasticity: You can scale upwards (increase the size of provisioned resources) and scale outwards (replication) dynamically to meet your demands. Scaling down, during slow periods for example, is also automated.</li>
            <li>Security: Cloud service providers handle the difficulties of security instead of you.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cloud Deployment Models</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Private Cloud: designated and operated solely for one organization. Hosted internally or externally and managed by internal teams. Search for OpenStack.</li>
            <li>Public Cloud: Open to the public after swipping your credit card, of course. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc..</li>
            <li>Hybrid Cloud: Both public and private cloud combined. You can host private info in your private cloud and offer public services on that information from the public cloud. You could also use the public clouds to scale up during demanding times.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Additional deployment models:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Community Cloud: Formed by multiple organizations sharing a the same infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Distributed Cloud: Connecting distributed systems in a single network.</li>
            <li>Multicloud: A single organization using multiple cloud providers. A means of avoiding vendor lock-in (vendor dependence).</li>
            <li>Poly Cloud: A single organization uses multiple cloud providers to leverage specific resources from each.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Virtualization</h3>
          <p>
            Virtualization can be used to virtualize hardware and software.<br>
            Virtual Machines (VMs) are virtual computers with a guest OS and software on them.<br>
            Hypervisor: the host machine runs this to create multiple VMs isolated from each other, with virtual resources.<br>
            Two main categories of hypervisors:
            <ol>
              <li>Type 1 hypervisor (native or bare-netal): Runs directly on top of the host machine's hardware, without the need of a host OS. Enterprise settings use this type: AWS Nitro, IBM z/VM, Microsoft Hyper-V, Nutanix AHV, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, Red Hat Virtualization, VMware ESXi, Xen.</li>
              <li>Type-2 Hypervisor (hosted): Runs on top of the host's OS. End-user is the typical consumer: Parallels Desktop for Mac, VirtualBox, Virtual Player, VMware Workstation.</li>
              <li>Hybrid type-1 and type-2: Linux kernal modules that act as both type-1 and type-2 hypervisors at the same time: KVM, bhyve.</li>
            </ol>
            Most modern CPUs allow hypervisors to virtualize physical hardware and <strong>nested virtualization</strong>, which enables VMs inside VMs.<br>
            <br>
            Emulators: allow software to run that was developed for different hardware. Quick EMUlator (QEMU) is one such emulator that allows you to run any OS on any archetecture, or for programs to run on originally unsupported systems.<br>
            Combining QEMU with KVM allows for amazing flexibility.
          </p>

          <h3>Kernal-based Virtual Machine (KVM)</h3>
          <p>
            A virtualization solution for Linux on x86 (It has been ported to FreeBSD, S/390, PowerPC, IA-64, and ARM). Converts the kernel into a hypervisor capable of managing guest VMs. Modern processors such as Intel VT and AMD-V need hardware virtualization extensions available and enabled for processors to support KVM.<br>
            Hardware emulation (QEMU) runs on a single thread to handle I/O requests to the host on behalf of the guest.<br>
            The KVM guest has virtual CPUs etc.. (kvm.ko runs in the kernel and handles requests by the guest)<br>
            Allows for device abstraction of NIC, disk, but not the processor. It exposes /dev/kvm interface that can be used by an external userspace host for emulation instead. (QEMU for example)<br>
            KVM supports nested hosts.<br>
            Supports hot pluggable devices such as CPUs and PCI devices.<br>
            Overcommitting is possible with KVM. This is handled by dynamically swapping unavailable resources needed from another guest that is not using the type of resource allocated. You can allocate more resources than are available on the system. Any VM is not going to run at 100% of allocated resources all the time, so we can share amoung many VMs.<br>
